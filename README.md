# Barcode scanner for Ionic

A full open-source code, you can add this code to your project with Ionic, this is just the /www & /plugins folders, so you must add this yourself on a new (or older) project which use Ionic. There is just a function : scan any barcode or qrcode... Retrieve the full list on the plugin barcode Github [page](https://github.com/zxing/zxing)

##Notes

Please check the code, if you don't need any plug-ins of my project (statusbar for example) or other: remove it because if you have a project already up, you can have some plugins or code uncompatible ... so don't copy / paste into your editor and run, check the code before, after that, you can use it!
